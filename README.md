# Unsupervised-Learning-Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation

This is a dataquest project, we’ll play the role of a data scientist working for a credit card company. We’ve been given a dataset containing information about the company’s clients and asked to help segment them into different groups in order to apply different business strategies for each type of customer.

The company expects to receive a group for each client and also an explanation of the characteristics of each group and what are the main points that make them different.

In a planning meeting with the Data Science coordinator, it was decided that we should use the K-means algorithm to segment the data.

In order to use the algorithm properly and achieve all the goals that the company has set for us, we'll go through the following steps:

Analyze the dataset;
Prepare the data for modeling;
Find an appropriate number of clusters;
Segment the data;
Interpret and explain the results.
